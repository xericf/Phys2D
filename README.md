# Physics Simulator

## What will the application do?

This application will be able to simulate various **2 dimensional objects based on newton's  
three laws of motion**. It will be able to model and showcase different types of physics  
phenomenon through pre-made scenarios designed to highlight a specific aspect of the physics  
engine. One such design may be an interactive demo of a ball bouncing on a user-controlled  
paddle.

## Who will use it?

*Game developers* will be the main audience for this application. They should be easily able to  
see an example and use case of how this physics engine works, and should also be able to  
implement my code into their programs too. *Physics enthusiasts and scientists* are hopefully  
my second target audience, where they may use my program to play around with experiments.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

I believe this project will be extremely rewarding to take on because it will challenge me to  
learn more about physics and about the real-world in general. Also, I hope to learn a lot about  
the practices and thought process behind designing game engines as I know it will help me solve  
difficult problems in the future.
